Vagrant Salt Webdev
===================

This is a very simple Vagrant configuration for web development. The provisioning is done using Salt. If you need Ruby you may need to select the default Ruby version after logging in using this command:

    rvm use 2.3.0


TODO
----

*   Continue working on the Salt configuration
*   Update readme
*   Implement Docker
